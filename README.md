## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/)(Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico) in Lisbon, Portugal.  
ðŸŒ± I'm expanding my knowledge beyond the curriculum by learning about Linux and Git.  
ðŸŽ¯ My current focus is to explore various areas in computer science to identify where I want to specialize and the skills I need to develop further.
