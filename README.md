## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Tiago Nogueira!!

 - I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [IST](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/leic-t)(Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico) in Lisbon, Portugal.  
 - ðŸŒ± I'm expanding my knowledge beyond the curriculum by learning about some tools.  
 - ðŸŽ¯ My current focus is to explore various areas in computer science to identify where I want to specialize and the skills I need to develop further.  

## Tools and languages
